    "In this notebook, we will study the application of physics informed data-driven modeling to the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations representing an incompressible fluid in the presence of a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$. Our model will be built using a Tensor Factorized Fourier Neural Operator (tFNO), and trained in conjunction with the PDEs representing our system. The model is physics-informed during training by encoding known information about the physical system into the loss functions,  enabling generalization of the resulting model to a variety of settings in the solution space. Specifically, the PDEs and initial conditions are used as soft constraints learned by the neural network as its trains. Models covering different data regimes governed by the Reynolds number are trained using transfer learning to showcase how our model may be applied to both laminar and turbulent flows. The AI-accelerated surrogate model is compared to classical simulations to compare its throughput and accuracy.\n",

    "To examine the properties of PINOs with multiple complex equations, we examined the ability of the networks to reproduce the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations representing an incompressible fluid in the presence of a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$. These equations are present in several astrophysical phenomena, including black hole accretion and binary neutron star mergers. Additionally, MDH has applications to nuclear power engineering, and plasma modeling. \n",

To obtain interesting results without additional computational difficulty, we will solve the equations in 2D with periodic boundary conditions. This results in solving a total of 3 evolution PDEs at each time step. Two for the velocity evolution, and one for the magnetic vector potential. \n",

To generate this data, `dedalus` is used to simulate a 2D periodic incompressible MHD flow with a passive tracer field for visualization. The initial flow is in the $x$-direction and depends only on $z$. The problem is non-dimensionalized using the shear-layer spacing and velocity jump, so the resulting viscosity and tracer diffusivity are related to the Reynolds and\n",

    "The initial data field for running the simulation is produced using the Gaussian Random Field method in which the radial basis function kernel (RBF) is transformed into Fourier space to obey the desired periodic boundary conditions. Finally, two initial data fields the vorticity potential and magnetic potential are used to guarantee initial velocity and magnetic fields are divergence free. \n",

    "## Defining our Constraints - Setting up the PDE\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints are used to define the objectives for training our model. They house a set of nodes from which a computational graph is build for execution as well as the loss function. [PhysicsNeMo Sim](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/physicsnemo/physicsnemo-sym/index.html) provides utilities tailored for physics-informed machine learning, and uses abstracted APIs that allow users to think and model the problem from the lens of equations, constraints, etc. In this example, we will only leverage the physics-informed utilities to see how we can add physics to an existing data-driven model with ease while still maintaining the flexibility to define our own training loop and other details. The types of constraints used will be problem dependent. For this example, we can define the following constraints: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Loss**: Obtain simulation data and compare it to the PINO output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PDE Loss**: Use the known PDEs of the system to describe violations of the time evolution of our system\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraint Loss**: This loss describes constraints from the PDE. Specifically, the velocity divergence free condition and magnetic divergence free condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Condition Loss**: Input field compared to the output at $t=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boundary Condition Loss**: Difference in boundary terms. In our case, we have a periodic boundary constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin setting up our constraints, we can start by defining the MHD equations using the `PDE` class from `physicsnemo.sym.eq.pde`. The process of converting our PDEs into a form that is compatible with `PhysicsNeMo` involves defining a class to hold our equations, called `MHD_PDE`, and including each term of the equations. Each variable of the equations is set up as a `Sympy` `Function`, which is then used to create an attribute of our `MHD_PDE` class that holds the final `equations`.\n",

    "Because we have elected to solve the equations in two dimensions, we only have the input variables $x$, $y$, $t$ and and the Laplacian operator. \n",
    "\n",

The output fields are the velocity in the $x$ direction ($u$), the velocity in the $y$ direction ($v$), and the magnetic vector potential ($\\mathbf{A}$).

Each Fourier layer consists of a sequence of non-logical integral operators, and nonlinear activation functions. $T_1$ represents a linear transform that employs CP decomposed tensors as weights, and $T_2$ represents a local linear transform. $\\sigma$ is the activation function, and $\\mathcal{F}$, $\\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ represent the Fourier transfrom and inverse Fourier transform respectively.

PhysicsNeMo Sym is a framework providing pythonic APIs, algorithms and utilities to be used with PhysicsNeMo Core, while PhysicsNeMo Core interoperates with PyTorch directly. Working with PhysicsNeMo Core looks and feels more like a PyTorch workflow with some key utils like models, utils, and datapipes imported directly from `physicsnemo` itself. While some components of this workflow so far have borrowed from PhysicsNeMo Sym (`MHD_PDE`), the training workflow for this problem will be build primarily using the Core style. This will provide more flexibility over our training loop, and allow for further customizations to our workflow. The training script follows the standard flow of training models using pytorch. \n"

    "In practice, our system may not follow smooth, laminar flows described with low Reynolds numbers. In MHD systems, much of the magnetic field energy is stored at high wave numbers, which occur at smaller scales. Models must then be able to characterize high frequency features in order to successfully reproduce the trajectories of the system. These turbulent flows at higher Reynolds number are simulated, which will in turn produce higher frequency features that a model trained on smooth flows may not be able to resolve with good accuracy. To this end, transfer learning can be used to take a base model and adapt it to the new data domain by using a pre-trained checkpoint as the starting point of a new iteration of model training. \n",

    "To run transfer learning, we need a dataset of points from our new domain. For example, our default model is trained on data using $Re=100$, so we can use the model checkpoint from this domain to start off transferlerning to a new dataset with $Re=250$. In the Hydra config, we can keep all of the same parameters, and update the following parameters:\n",

    "## Evaluation\n",
    "When solving the MHD equations with `dedalus`, the average time per simulation is about 37 seconds. On the other hand, our physics informed model has an average inference time of 0.15 seconds, a 246x speedup. This comes at the cost of decreased accuracy in our solution, as it is an approximation to the system equations. Furthermore, our models performance will vary, depending on the Reynolds number. \n",

    "Evaluation can be run a few different ways. If there are many systems to evaluate, we can load them into a dataloader and do batch processing. In this example, we will use a standalone script, which is a stripped down version of the training script that will run our model with a single sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run evaluation we can use the following command, which pulls in a config that points to a specific pre-trained checkpoint and dataset. The  config is found in `eval_mhd_vec_pot_tfno_Re100.yaml`\n",

    "In evaluations, our model is able to accurately simulate flows at $Re<250$. Specifically, for $Re=100$, our surrogate model has less than 4% error at $t=1$ for all fields. At $Re=250$, the velocity field and vector potential potential are accurately described, with MSEs <7% and <10%, respectively. At higher Reynolds numbers, our model starts to break down. An example for $Re=100$ is shown below, as well as some plots showing $MSE$ vs $Re$.\n",

    "## Shortcomings and areas for improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics informed machine learning shows promising results when applied to certain regions of parameter space as governed by the Reynolds number. While models such as tFNOs are able to accurately capture and simulate systems, they do not always perform well when the underlying physics begin to shift into regions of high frequency features. A tradeoff is present in accuracy and throughput, where these AI surrogate models accelerate simulations over 200x, however they remain accuracy for only the low Reynolds number parameter space. To this end, applying physics informed ML to the MHD equations shows both promise and room for improvement. For example, increased model size, additional physical loss functions from energy spectra, and higher resolution datasets may be a few areas in which the development and application of these models may be improved. In conclusion, the efficacy of physics informed machine learning has been shown to the modeling of magnetohydrodynamics, and researchers, scientists, and engineers are encouraged to build on this foundation to enhance these techniques further.
